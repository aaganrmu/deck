# Software


## Create boot ASCII (or whatever) graphics (CLI)
- Figure out UX that isn't too intruding
- Still should look nice
- Maybe add some services to interject into boot sequence?
- Change up boot sequence?

## Create functionality for OLED:
- Mode switching (GPIO)
- Nice images

# Hardware

## Case
- Front panel PMMA. Painted from inside?
- Middle layer: plastic profiles attached to plate. Components attached to plate. Holes for displays.
- Back layer: more PMMA

## Buy remaining items
- Upgrade RPI (3B has relatively low power usage)

## Buzzer
- Switch using transistor?

## Wiring
- To case (use PCBs?)
- Add lightpipes if needed
