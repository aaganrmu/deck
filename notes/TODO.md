# Software

## Create boot ASCII (or whatever) graphics (CLI)
- Figure out UX that isn't too intruding
- Still should look nice
- Maybe add some services to interject into boot sequence?
- Change up boot sequence?

# hardware

## Create functionality for OLED:
- Mode switching (GPIO)
- Nice images

## Case
- Back layer: more PMMA, held with small bolts & nuts
- Figure out how to mount OLED better (small bolts?)
- Secure RPI (double sided tape will do)
- Make new expansion board for OLED & buttons
- Add buzzer board
- Strap for carrying

## Buy remaining items
- Connectors for buttons are coming in soon, will replace oversized ones
